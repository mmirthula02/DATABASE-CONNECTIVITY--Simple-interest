JDBC is a technology that enables the data program to manipulate the data stored in the data base.
It allows the Java program to access database management system using Java code.

What is a Backend database?
The application usually stores the data in the form of database, which is used by the application to give suitable response
to the user. This database is called Backend database.A good database also ensures easy modifications of the 
applications whenever needed.

ABOUT THE PROJECT:
This is a database connectivity project .The IDE environment used for this project is NetBeans.
This project is used to calculate the simple interest and all the information is stored on the database.
Details like name of the customer,principal amount,rate and duration is been collected from the customer and the simple interest is 
calculated by checking if the latter is a new one or a frequent existing customer.
Each and every time the customer enter the details in the form, it is stored on the database.
Further in this project I have created a customer simple interest table in MySQL platform, where all the details of
the customer is been stored on thid database.

1.It calculates simple interest
2. Every records entered are stored in the backend database
3. you can delete previous unwanted records
